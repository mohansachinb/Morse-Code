# Morse-Code
<p>In Java, Map Interface is present in java.util package represents a mapping between a key and a value. Java Map interface is not a subtype of the Collection interface. Therefore it behaves a bit differently from the rest of the collection types. A map contains unique keys</p>
<p>Maps are perfect to use for key-value association mapping such as dictionaries. The maps are used to perform lookups by keys or when someone wants to retrieve and update elements by keys. Some common scenarios are as follows: 

A map of error codes and their descriptions.
A map of zip codes and cities.
A map of managers and employees. Each manager (key) is associated with a list of employees (value) he manages.
A map of classes and students. Each class (key) is associated with a list of students (value).</p>

<p><h>Creating Map Objects</h>
Since Map is an interface, objects cannot be created of the type map. We always need a class that extends this map in order to create an object. And also, after the introduction of Generics in Java 1.5, it is possible to restrict the type of object that can be stored in the Map. 

<h3>Syntax:</h3>

Map hm = new HashMap(); 
# Obj is the type of the object to be stored in Map</p>
